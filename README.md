## Meme-Lang
Welcome to Meme Lang

This one was amongst one of my bucket list to develop a programming language based entirely on indian meme dialogues

The language is still in initial stages
Feel free to PR and contribute

# Salient things
- Have a LISP like syntax ( starting with () brackets)
- I have created an implicit file type `.memel` to support. Other file types not supported ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
- Following are the operations currently developed
    - Add = maaroMujhe
    - Subtract = nikal
    - Multiply = chandPeHaiApun
    - Divide = abeySaale
    - modulo = schemeBtade
- So a basic thing like 2+(5-3) will look something like `(maaroMujhe 2 (nikal 5 3))`. Which is not efficient but this is because how i made it
- To run , run `npm link` for one time to install locally the language then
    - To run the console(like in python) just run `memelang`
    - To run a file type `memelang run your-file-name.memel`

- The Language is new so might be prone to subsequent errors and failing


## Getting started

`npm install`
